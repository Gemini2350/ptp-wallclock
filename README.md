# ptp-wallclock
This is a simple Wallclock for Raspberry Pi with a LED Display.
I've used it to demonstrate that PTP is really distributing the Time at my Speech at Chaos Computer Club
A lot of people asked for it, that's why im distributing the Code here.
I'm a rellay bad Coder and most of it is based on ChatGpt.
